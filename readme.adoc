____
CadQueryv1.2 can be easily integrated into FreeCAD and be used with FreeCAD graphical interface. +
On the other hand, CadQuery v2.0 is a new fork of CadQuery that is independent from FreeCAD. +
We consider that it could be a promising alternative. +
At the present day the two versions remain compatible; hence,the CadQuery filter stage model and the code snippets shown in this paper are valid for both versions.

Interesting compare of simple mesh. +
FreeCAD is more complex ... but more portable and powerful !
OpenSCAD is simpler and suitable for 3D printing usage.
